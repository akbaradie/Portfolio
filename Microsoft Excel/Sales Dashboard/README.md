# Coffee Sales Dashboard


## Objective
I did some practice using VLOOKUP, and conditional statement in Microsoft Excel. Then, I did EDA by making pivot tables from the data. Last, I made Sales Dashboard which include: growth overtime (sell, buy, and profit), monthly sales and profit, top 5 sales by product, and proportion of sales type, payment method, and product category.

## Result
1. Dashboard Preview
